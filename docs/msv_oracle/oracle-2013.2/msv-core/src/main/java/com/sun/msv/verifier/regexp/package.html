<P>VGM implementation by using regular expression derivation algorithm.</P>
<P>This implementation bridges a gap between 
neutral&nbsp;grammar model (com.sun.msv.grammar) and Verifier grammar 
model (com.sun.msv.verifier). </P>
<H2>Performance Analysis</H2>
<P> This bridge is tuned for client-side use, where MSV is repeatedly 
invoked from command line. Particularly,</P>
<OL>
  <LI>
  <DIV>No preprocessing&nbsp;of grammar is necessary. Abstract grammar model can 
  be directly used. This results in faster schema loading, at the expense of 
  slower validation.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>Extensive error recovery and detailed error diagnosis is 
  provided.</DIV></LI></OL>
<P>Also, this bridge covers full expressiveness of RELAX and 
TREX. </P>
<H2>Algorithm </H2>

may want to see the following resources. </P>
