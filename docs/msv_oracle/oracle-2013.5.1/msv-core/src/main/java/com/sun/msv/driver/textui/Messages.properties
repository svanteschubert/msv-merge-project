usage: java -jar msv.jar <opts> <grammar> <instance1> [<instance2> ...]\n\
\n\
options:\n\
\ \ -standalone: do not read external DTD specified in grammar/instances.\n\
\ \ -strict    : perform extra check to schema and report error.\n\
\ \ -dump      : dump grammar rather than perform validation.\n\

\ \ -verbose   : be verbose.\n\
\ \ -maxerror  : try to report more errors even if they may be false.\n\
\ \ -warning   : display all warning messages\n\
\ \ -catalog <catalogfile>\n\
\ \            : use a catalog file (TR9401) to resolve external entities\n\

\ \ -classpath <jar>/<dir>\n\
\ \            : use this option to specify additional datatype library\n\
\ \              jar files for RELAX NG validation. Can be specified multiple times\n\
\ \ -locale <code>\n\
\ \            : set the language of messages (i.e., "en","ja")\n\
